## FastAPI_Project: Rehabilitation Centre Manangement Systsem
This project is built using FastAPI and is used to keep track of patient data. It contains functionality to add and rehabilitate patients. Records are maintained for admitted, transferred and rehabilitated patients and they are updated as well. Seperate provisons are provided to change patient treatment status. 

Database connectivity has been done using MongoDB for easy connectivity. MongoDB is a new platform for me, and I am still exploring it :).

Hope this helps.
